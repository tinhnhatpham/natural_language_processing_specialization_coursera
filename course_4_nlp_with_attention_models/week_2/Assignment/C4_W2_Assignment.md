### Introduction

Summarization is an important task in natural language processing and could be useful for a consumer enterprise. For example, bots can be used to scrape articles, summarize them, and then you can use sentiment analysis to identify the sentiment about certain stocks. Anyways who wants to read an article or a long email today, when you can build a transformer to summarize text for you. Let's get started, by completing this assignment you will learn to:  

- Use built-in functions to preprocess your data
- Implement DotProductAttention
- Implement Causal Attention
- Understand how attention works
- Build the transformer model
- Evaluate your model
- Summarize an article

As you can tell, this model is slightly different than the ones you have already implemented. This is heavily based on attention and does not rely on sequences, which allows for parallel computing. 


```python
import sys
import os
import w2_tests
import numpy as np

import textwrap
wrapper = textwrap.TextWrapper(width=70)

import trax
from trax import layers as tl
from trax.fastmath import numpy as jnp

# to print the entire np array
np.set_printoptions(threshold=sys.maxsize)
```


```python
!pip list|grep trax
```

    trax                         1.3.9

## Part 1: Importing the dataset

Trax makes it easy to work with Tensorflow's datasets:


```python
# This will download the dataset if no data_dir is specified.
# Downloading and processing can take bit of time,
# so we have the data already in 'data/' for you

# Importing CNN/DailyMail articles dataset
train_stream_fn = trax.data.TFDS('cnn_dailymail',
                                 data_dir='data/',
                                 keys=('article', 'highlights'),
                                 train=True)

# This should be much faster as the data is downloaded already.
eval_stream_fn = trax.data.TFDS('cnn_dailymail',
                                data_dir='data/',
                                keys=('article', 'highlights'),
                                train=False)
```

## 1.1 Tokenize & Detokenize helper functions

Just like in the previous assignment, the cell above loads in the encoder for you. Given any data set, you have to be able to map words to their indices, and indices to their words. The inputs and outputs to your [Trax](https://github.com/google/trax) models are usually tensors of numbers where each number corresponds to a word. If you were to process your data manually, you would have to make use of the following: 

- <span style='color:blue'> word2Ind: </span> a dictionary mapping the word to its index.
- <span style='color:blue'> ind2Word:</span> a dictionary mapping the index to its word.
- <span style='color:blue'> word2Count:</span> a dictionary mapping the word to the number of times it appears. 
- <span style='color:blue'> num_words:</span> total number of words that have appeared. 

Since you have already implemented these in previous assignments of the specialization, we will provide you with helper functions that will do this for you. Run the cell below to get the following functions:

- <span style='color:blue'> tokenize: </span> converts a text sentence to its corresponding token list (i.e. list of indices). Also converts words to subwords.
- <span style='color:blue'> detokenize: </span> converts a token list to its corresponding sentence (i.e. string).


```python
def tokenize(input_str, EOS=1):
    """Input str to features dict, ready for inference"""
  
    # Use the trax.data.tokenize method. It takes streams and returns streams,
    # we get around it by making a 1-element stream with `iter`.
    inputs =  next(trax.data.tokenize(iter([input_str]),
                                      vocab_dir='vocab_dir/',
                                      vocab_file='summarize32k.subword.subwords'))
    
    # Mark the end of the sentence with EOS
    return list(inputs) + [EOS]

def detokenize(integers):
    """List of ints to str"""
  
    s = trax.data.detokenize(integers,
                             vocab_dir='vocab_dir/',
                             vocab_file='summarize32k.subword.subwords')
    
    return wrapper.fill(s)
```

## 1.2 Preprocessing for Language Models: Concatenate It!

This week you will use a language model -- Transformer Decoder -- to solve
an input-output problem. As you know, language models only predict the next
word, they have no notion of inputs. To create a single input suitable for
a language model, we concatenate inputs with targets putting a separator
in between. We also need to create a mask -- with 0s at inputs and 1s at targets -- so that the model is not penalized for mis-predicting the article and only focuses on the summary. See the preprocess function below for how this is done.


```python
# Special tokens
SEP = 0 # Padding or separator token
EOS = 1 # End of sentence token

# Concatenate tokenized inputs and targets using 0 as separator.
def preprocess(stream):
    for (article, summary) in stream:
        joint = np.array(list(article) + [EOS, SEP] + list(summary) + [EOS])
        mask = [0] * (len(list(article)) + 2) + [1] * (len(list(summary)) + 1) # Accounting for EOS and SEP
        yield joint, joint, np.array(mask)

# You can combine a few data preprocessing steps into a pipeline like this.
input_pipeline = trax.data.Serial(
    # Tokenizes
    trax.data.Tokenize(vocab_dir='vocab_dir/',
                       vocab_file='summarize32k.subword.subwords'),
    # Uses function defined above
    preprocess,
    # Filters out examples longer than 2048
    trax.data.FilterByLength(2048)
)

# Apply preprocessing to data streams.
train_stream = input_pipeline(train_stream_fn())
eval_stream = input_pipeline(eval_stream_fn())

train_input, train_target, train_mask = next(train_stream)
assert sum((train_input - train_target)**2) == 0  # They are the same in Language Model (LM).
```


```python
# prints mask, 0s on article, 1s on summary
print(f'Single example mask:\n\n {train_mask}')
```

## 1.3 Batching with bucketing

As in the previous week, we use bucketing to create batches of data.


```python
# Bucketing to create batched generators.

# Buckets are defined in terms of boundaries and batch sizes.
# Batch_sizes[i] determines the batch size for items with length < boundaries[i]
# So below, we'll take a batch of 16 sentences of length < 128 , 8 of length < 256,
# 4 of length < 512. And so on. 
boundaries =  [128, 256,  512, 1024]
batch_sizes = [16,    8,    4,    2, 1]

# Create the streams.
train_batch_stream = trax.data.BucketByLength(
    boundaries, batch_sizes)(train_stream)

eval_batch_stream = trax.data.BucketByLength(
    boundaries, batch_sizes)(eval_stream)
```


```python
# Every execution will result in generation of a different article
# Try running this cell multiple times to see how the length of the examples affects the batch size
input_batch, _, mask_batch = next(train_batch_stream)

# Shape of the input_batch
input_batch.shape
```




    (1, 1188)




```python
# print corresponding integer values
print(input_batch[0])
```

    Article:
    
     By . Chris Pleasance . PUBLISHED: . 08:09 EST, 15 September 2013 . | .
    UPDATED: . 06:05 EST, 16 September 2013 . With divorce fast becoming
    the norm it seems true love is harder and harder to find these days.
    But as these letters reveal, one smitten couple found a love so strong
    it was able to endure even while they were separated during World War
    II. Not only that, it lasted for a total of 70 years of marriage until
    they both died in 2011, he aged 96 and she aged 92, within just three
    days of one another. How time passes: Frederick and Elizabeth Noble
    wed on New Year's Day 1941 while Frederick . was on 48-hour leave from
    the Royal Tank Corps and stayed married for . the next 70 years . But,
    as remarkable as their relationship had seemed in life, in death it
    was about to give up its biggest and most heartwarming surprise. After
    Frederick and Elizabeth Noble had passed relatives discovered they had
    kept 250 love letters, telegrams, notes and Valentine's cards from
    each other. Their grandson, Dr Andrew Rowland, has taken them along to
    the Antique Roadshow TV program. In one extract read on tonight's
    show, Frederick writes: 'You are the most wonderful, marvellous,
    precious, beloved, lovable, . adoring, adorable, charming, divine and
    loving sweetheart wife that has . ever lived. 'Darling, come a little
    closer and let me whisper in . your darling ears, all these loving
    words, because they are meant for . you, my sweetheart.' The pair
    wrote a series of remarkable and passionate love letters to one
    another throughout World War II . The amazing collection of 250
    letters, telegrams, notes and Valentine's cards was stored in a tea
    chest . The couple, who shared the same birthday, kept the memories
    stashed away inside a tea chest in their home in Wingate, County
    Durham. Speaking about the letters, Fiona Bruce, the show's host,
    said: 'Theirs was a real love story. What struck me about the .
    letters was the sheer outpouring of emotion across their pages. 'They
    . reveal two people who had fallen headlong in love - and that love
    burned . even more brightly while they were forced apart by war.'
    Frederick and Elizabeth Noble wed on New Year's Day in 1941 while he
    was on 48-hour leave from the Royal Tank Corps. He had volunteered for
    the Army in 1936 despite having been selected . as a professional
    footballer by Aston Villa and served in Afghanistan, . India, Burma,
    Ceylon and France. From these war-torn . countries he wrote the tear-
    jerking telegrams to his wife who was . nursing injured servicemen
    back home. After the war, . Elizabeth carried on her work as a nurse
    while Frederick became a miner . in the East Durham coalfield, before
    rising to the position of colliery overseer. During their long lives
    the besotted pair built up a large family of two daughters, four
    grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren and it was grandson who
    discovered the letters . Perhaps the most heart-wrenching messages
    were written when Frederick's leave was cancelled. He says: 'I'm very
    sorry my beloved, I can't get home. That's all I live for, . home and
    you. In another passage he adds: 'We both feel the same when I have to
    return from leave. I have to take a . firm hold of myself or I would
    never come back. 'I hate to see the back . of you as my bus or train
    pulls out because I know it will be weeks . before I set eyes on you
    again. It's terrible when we have to part - too . awful for words.'
    Showing a touch of humour, Frederick writes again to compliment his
    wife's skill in the kitchen: 'Darling, no matter what you think, I
    still say that you are a good cook . - so let's not have a small row.
    You know I wish that today I could . have sat down to one of your
    dinners.' Elizabeth's communication is more limited, as she was kept
    in the dark about where her husband was to keep military operations a
    secret. In the letters she did write she talks about the home front,
    rationing, and hiding under the kitchen table while bombs fell on the
    main road near their house. Only a small selection of letter were
    taken to Antiques Roadshow for filming and the family are keeping the
    rest secret while they decide what to do with them . While the letters
    reveal a lot about the couple's marriage, the war and their incredible
    devotion to one another, only a small selection were taken along to
    the show's filming in North Yorkshire. The rest are being kept a
    secret while the family, made up of the couple's two daughters, four
    grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, decide what to do with
    them. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Dr Rowland revealed that
    towards the end of their lives the pair talked about not wanting to go
    on without each other. He said that the family were comforted in their
    sadness by the thought that, in the end, Elizabeth had only had to
    endure three days without her beloved other half. Frederick died
    peacefully on December 4th, 2011, and Elizabeth on December
    7th.<EOS><pad>Frederickand Elizabeth Noble married in 1941 while he

    chest . The pair, who shared a birthday, both died in 2011 just three
    days apart having said they could not bear to be without one another

# Part 2: Summarization with transformer

Now that we have given you the data generator and have handled the preprocessing for you, it is time for you to build your own model. We saved you some time because we know you have already preprocessed data before in this specialization, so we would rather you spend your time doing the next steps. 

You will be implementing the attention from scratch and then using it in your transformer model. Concretely, you will understand how attention works, how you use it to connect the encoder and the decoder.

## 2.1 Dot product attention 

Now you will implement dot product attention which takes in a query, key, value, and a mask. It returns the output. 

<img src ="images/dotproduct.png">


Here are some helper functions that will help you create tensors and display useful information:
   - `create_tensor`  creates a `jax numpy array` from a list of lists.
   - `display_tensor` prints out the shape and the actual tensor.


```python
def create_tensor(t):
    """Create tensor from list of lists"""
    return jnp.array(t)


def display_tensor(t, name):
    """Display shape and tensor"""
    print(f'{name} shape: {t.shape}\n')
    print(f'{t}\n')
```

Before implementing it yourself, you can play around with a toy example of `dot product attention` without the softmax  operation. Technically it would not be `dot product attention` without the softmax but this is done to avoid giving away too much of the answer and the idea is to display these tensors to give you a sense of how they look like.

The formula for attention is this one:

$$
\text { Attention }(Q, K, V)=\operatorname{softmax}\left(\frac{Q K^{T}}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}+{M}\right) V\tag{1}\
$$

$d_{k}$ stands for the dimension of queries and keys.

The `query`, `key`, `value` and `mask` vectors are provided for this example.

Notice that the masking is done using very negative values that will yield a similar effect to using $-\infty $. 


```python
q = create_tensor([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]])
display_tensor(q, 'query')
k = create_tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
display_tensor(k, 'key')
v = create_tensor([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]])
display_tensor(v, 'value')
m = create_tensor([[0, 0], [-1e9, 0]])
display_tensor(m, 'mask')
```

    query shape: (2, 3)
    
    [[1 0 0]
     [0 1 0]]
    
    key shape: (2, 3)
    
    [[1 2 3]
     [4 5 6]]
    
    value shape: (2, 3)
    
    [[0 1 0]
     [1 0 1]]
    
    mask shape: (2, 2)
    
    [[ 0.e+00  0.e+00]
     [-1.e+09  0.e+00]]
    


**Expected Output:**
```CPP
query shape: (2, 3)

[[1 0 0]

 [1 0 1]]

mask shape: (2, 2)

[[ 0.e+00  0.e+00]

```


```python
q_dot_k = q @ k.T / jnp.sqrt(3)
display_tensor(q_dot_k, 'query dot key')
```

    query dot key shape: (2, 2)

```

In order to use the previous dummy tensors to test some of the graded functions, a batch dimension should be added to them so they mimic the shape of real-life examples. The mask is also replaced by a version of it that resembles the one that is used by trax:


```python
q_with_batch = q[None,:]
display_tensor(q_with_batch, 'query with batch dim')
k_with_batch = k[None,:]
display_tensor(k_with_batch, 'key with batch dim')
v_with_batch = v[None,:]
display_tensor(v_with_batch, 'value with batch dim')
m_bool = create_tensor([[True, True], [False, True]])
display_tensor(m_bool, 'boolean mask')
```

    query with batch dim shape: (1, 2, 3)
    
    [[[1 0 0]
      [0 1 0]]]
    
    key with batch dim shape: (1, 2, 3)
    
    [[[1 2 3]
      [4 5 6]]]
    
    value with batch dim shape: (1, 2, 3)
    
    [[[0 1 0]
      [1 0 1]]]
    
    boolean mask shape: (2, 2)
    
    [[ True  True]
     [False  True]]
    


**Expected Output:**
```CPP
query with batch dim shape: (1, 2, 3)

[[[1 0 0]
  [0 1 0]]]

key with batch dim shape: (1, 2, 3)

[[[1 2 3]
  [4 5 6]]]

value with batch dim shape: (1, 2, 3)

[[[0 1 0]
  [1 0 1]]]

boolean mask shape: (2, 2)

[[ True  True]
 [False  True]]
```

### Exercise 01

**Instructions:** Implement the dot product attention. Concretely, implement the following equation


$$
\text { Attention }(Q, K, V)=\operatorname{softmax}\left(\frac{Q K^{T}}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}+{M}\right) V\tag{1}\
$$

$Q$ - query, 
$K$ - key, 
$V$ - values, 
$M$ - mask, 
${d_k}$ - depth/dimension of the queries and keys (used for scaling down)

You can implement this formula either by `trax` numpy (trax.math.numpy) or regular `numpy` but it is recommended to use `jnp`.

Something to take into consideration is that within trax, the masks are tensors of `True/False` values not 0's and $-\infty$ as in the previous example. Within the graded function don't think of applying the mask by summing up matrices, instead use `jnp.where()` and treat the **mask as a tensor of boolean values with `False` for values that need to be masked and True for the ones that don't.**

Also take into account that the real tensors are far more complex than the toy ones you just played with. Because of this avoid using shortened operations such as `@` for dot product or `.T` for transposing. Use `jnp.matmul()` and `jnp.swapaxes()` instead.

This is the self-attention block for the transformer decoder. Good luck!  


```python
# UNQ_C1
# GRADED FUNCTION: DotProductAttention
def DotProductAttention(query, key, value, mask):
    """Dot product self-attention.

        value (jax.interpreters.xla.DeviceArray): array of value representations with shape (L_k by d) where L_v = L_k
        mask (jax.interpreters.xla.DeviceArray): attention-mask, gates attention with shape (L_q by L_k)

    Returns:

    """

    assert query.shape[-1] == key.shape[-1] == value.shape[-1], "Embedding dimensions of q, k, v aren't all the same"

    ### START CODE HERE (REPLACE INSTANCES OF 'None' WITH YOUR CODE) ###
    # Save depth/dimension of the query embedding for scaling down the dot product
    depth = query.shape[-1]

    # Calculate scaled query key dot product according to formula above
    dots = jnp.matmul(query, jnp.swapaxes(key, -1, -2)) / jnp.sqrt(depth)
    
    # Apply the mask
    if mask is not None: # You do not need to replace the 'None' on this line
        dots = jnp.where(mask, dots, jnp.full_like(dots, -1e9))
    
    # Softmax formula implementation

    # Note: softmax = None
    logsumexp = trax.fastmath.logsumexp(dots, axis=-1, keepdims=True)

    # Take exponential of dots minus logsumexp to get softmax
    # Use jnp.exp()
    dots = jnp.exp(dots - logsumexp)

    # Multiply dots by value to get self-attention

## 2.2 Causal Attention

Now you are going to implement causal attention: multi-headed attention with a mask to attend only to words that occurred before. 

<img src = "images/causal.png">

In the image above, a word can see everything that is before it, but not what is after it. To implement causal attention, you will have to transform vectors and do many reshapes. You will need to implement the functions below.


<a name='ex02'></a>
### Exercise 02

Implement the following functions that will be needed for Causal Attention:

- <span style='color:blue'> compute_attention_heads </span>: Gets an input $x$ of dimension (n_batch, seqlen, n_heads $\times$ d_head) and splits the last (depth) dimension and stacks it to the zeroth dimension to allow matrix multiplication (n_batch $\times$ n_heads, seqlen, d_head).
- <span style='color:blue'> dot_product_self_attention </span>: Creates a mask matrix with `False` values above the diagonal and `True` values below and calls DotProductAttention which implements dot product self attention.
- <span style='color:blue'> compute_attention_output </span>: Undoes compute_attention_heads by splitting first (vertical) dimension and stacking in the last (depth) dimension (n_batch, seqlen, n_heads $\times$ d_head). These operations concatenate (stack/merge) the heads. 

Next there are some toy tensors which may serve to give you an idea of the data shapes and opperations involved in Causal Attention. They are also useful to test out your functions! 


```python
tensor2d = create_tensor(q)
display_tensor(tensor2d, 'query matrix (2D tensor)')

tensor4d2b = create_tensor([[q, q], [q, q]])
display_tensor(tensor4d2b, 'batch of two (multi-head) collections of query matrices (4D tensor)')

tensor3dc = create_tensor([jnp.concatenate([q, q], axis = -1)])
display_tensor(tensor3dc, 'one batch of concatenated heads of query matrices (3d tensor)')

tensor3dc3b = create_tensor([jnp.concatenate([q, q], axis = -1), jnp.concatenate([q, q], axis = -1), jnp.concatenate([q, q], axis = -1)])
display_tensor(tensor3dc3b, 'three batches of concatenated heads of query matrices (3d tensor)')
```

    query matrix (2D tensor) shape: (2, 3)
    
    [[1 0 0]
     [0 1 0]]
    
    batch of two (multi-head) collections of query matrices (4D tensor) shape: (2, 2, 2, 3)
    
    [[[[1 0 0]
       [0 1 0]]
    
      [[1 0 0]
       [0 1 0]]]
    
    
     [[[1 0 0]
       [0 1 0]]
    
      [[1 0 0]
       [0 1 0]]]]
    
    one batch of concatenated heads of query matrices (3d tensor) shape: (1, 2, 6)
    
    [[[1 0 0 1 0 0]
      [0 1 0 0 1 0]]]
    
    three batches of concatenated heads of query matrices (3d tensor) shape: (3, 2, 6)
    
    [[[1 0 0 1 0 0]
      [0 1 0 0 1 0]]
    
     [[1 0 0 1 0 0]
      [0 1 0 0 1 0]]
    
     [[1 0 0 1 0 0]
      [0 1 0 0 1 0]]]
    


It is important to know that the following 3 functions would normally be defined within the `CausalAttention` function further below. 

However this makes these functions harder to test. Because of this, these functions are shown individually using a `closure` (when necessary) that simulates them being inside of the `CausalAttention` function. This is done because they rely on some variables that can be accessed from within `CausalAttention`.

### Support Functions

<span style='color:blue'> compute_attention_heads </span>: Gets an input $x$ of dimension (n_batch, seqlen, n_heads $\times$ d_head) and splits the last (depth) dimension and stacks it to the zeroth dimension to allow matrix multiplication (n_batch $\times$ n_heads, seqlen, d_head).

**For the closures you only have to fill the inner function.**


```python
# UNQ_C2

### Causal Attention Function

Now it is time for you to put everything together within the `CausalAttention` or Masked multi-head attention function:

<img src = "images/masked-attention.png"> 

**Instructions:** Implement the causal attention.
Your model returns the causal attention through a $tl.Serial$ with the following:

- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Branch](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Branch) </span>: consisting of 3 [tl.Dense(d_feature), ComputeAttentionHeads] to account for the queries, keys, and values.
- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Fn](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.base.Fn)</span>: Takes in dot_product_self_attention function and uses it to compute the dot product using $Q$, $K$, $V$.
- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Fn](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.base.Fn)</span>: Takes in compute_attention_output_closure to allow for parallel computing.
- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Dense](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dense)</span>: Final Dense layer, with dimension `d_feature`.

Remember that in order for trax to properly handle the functions you just defined, they need to be added as layers using the [`tl.Fn()`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.base.Fn) function.

## 2.3 Transformer decoder block

Now that you have implemented the causal part of the transformer, you will implement the transformer decoder block. Concretely you will be implementing this image now.

<img src = "images/transformer_decoder_1.png" style = "height:300px"> 

To implement this function, you will have to call the `CausalAttention` or Masked multi-head attention function you implemented above. You will have to add a feedforward which consists of: 

- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.LayerNorm](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.normalization.LayerNorm) </span>: used to layer normalize
- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Dense](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dense) </span>: the dense layer
- <span style='color:blue'> [ff_activation](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.activation_fns.Relu) </span>: feed forward activation (we use ReLu) here.
- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Dropout](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dropout) </span>: dropout layer
- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Dense](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dense) </span>: dense layer
- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Dropout](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dropout) </span>: dropout layer

Finally once you implement the feedforward, you can go ahead and implement the entire block using: 

- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Residual](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Residual) </span>: takes in the tl.LayerNorm(), causal attention block, tl.dropout. 

- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Residual](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Residual) </span>: takes in the feedforward block you will implement.

# Part 3: Training

Now you are going to train your model. As usual, you have to define the cost function, the optimizer, and decide whether you will be training it on a `gpu` or `cpu`. In this case, you will train your model on a cpu for a few steps and we will load in a pre-trained model that you can use to predict with your own words.

<a name='3.1'></a>
### 3.1 Training the model

You will now write a function that takes in your model and trains it. To train your model you have to decide how many times you want to iterate over the entire data set. Each iteration is defined as an `epoch`. For each epoch, you have to go over all the data, using your training iterator.

<a name='ex05'></a>
### Exercise 05
**Instructions:** Implement the `train_model` program below to train the neural network above. Here is a list of things you should do:

- Create the train task by calling [`trax.supervised.training.TrainTask`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.supervised.html#trax.supervised.training.TrainTask) and pass in the following: 
    - <span style='color:blue'> labeled_data </span> = train_gen
    - <span style='color:blue'> loss_fn </span> = [tl.CrossEntropyLoss()](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.metrics.CrossEntropyLoss)
    - <span style='color:blue'> optimizer </span> = [trax.optimizers.Adam(0.01)](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.optimizers.html#trax.optimizers.adam.Adam)
    - <span style='color:blue'> lr_schedule </span> = [lr_schedule](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.supervised.html#trax.supervised.lr_schedules.warmup_and_rsqrt_decay)


- Create the eval task by calling [`trax.supervised.training.EvalTask`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.supervised.html#trax.supervised.training.EvalTask) and pass in the following: 
    - <span style='color:blue'> labeled_data </span> = eval_gen
    - <span style='color:blue'> metrics </span> = tl.CrossEntropyLoss() and [tl.Accuracy()](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.metrics.Accuracy)
    
    
- Create the training loop by calling [`trax.supervised.Training.Loop`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.supervised.html#trax.supervised.training.Loop) and pass in the following: 
    - <span style='color:blue'> TransformerLM </span> 
    - <span style='color:blue'> train_task </span> 
    - <span style='color:blue'> eval_task </span> = [eval_task]
    - <span style='color:blue'> output_dir</span> = output_dir
    
You will be using a cross entropy loss, with Adam optimizer. Please read the [Trax](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) documentation to get a full understanding. 

The training loop that this function returns can be runned using the `run()` method by passing in the desired number of steps.

Notice that the model will be trained for only 10 steps. 

Even with this constraint the model with the original default arguments took a very long time to finish. Because of this some parameters are changed when defining the model that is fed into the training loop in the function above.

### 4.1 Loading in a trained model

In this part you will evaluate by loading in an almost exact version of the model you coded, but we trained it for you to save you time. Please run the cell below to load in the model.

As you may have already noticed the model that you trained and the pretrained model share the same overall architecture but they have different values for some of the parameters:

    
   `Original (pretrained) model: `                                 
                                       
    TransformerLM(vocab_size=33300, d_model=512, d_ff=2048, n_layers=6, n_heads=8, 
                   dropout=0.1, max_len=4096, ff_activation=tl.Relu)
                   
   `Your model:`
   
    TransformerLM(d_model=4, d_ff=16, n_layers=1, n_heads=2)
   
   **Only the parameters shown for your model were changed. The others stayed the same.**


```python
# Get the model architecture
model = TransformerLM(mode='eval')

# Load the pre-trained weights
model.init_from_file('model.pkl.gz', weights_only=True)
```

# Part 5: Testing with your own input

You will now test your input. You are going to implement greedy decoding. This consists of two functions. The first one allows you to identify the next symbol. It gets the argmax of the output of your model and then returns that index. 

<a name='ex06'></a>
### Exercise 06
**Instructions:** Implement the next symbol function that takes in the cur_output_tokens and the trained model to return the the index of the next word. 


```python
# UNQ_C9
def next_symbol(cur_output_tokens, model):
    """Returns the next symbol for a given sentence.

    Args:
        cur_output_tokens (list): tokenized sentence with EOS and PAD tokens at the end.
        model (trax.layers.combinators.Serial): The transformer model.

    Returns:
        int: tokenized symbol.
    """
    ### START CODE HERE (REPLACE INSTANCES OF 'None' WITH YOUR CODE) ###
    
    # current output tokens length
    token_length = len(cur_output_tokens)
    # calculate the minimum power of 2 big enough to store token_length
    # HINT: use np.ceil() and np.log2()
    # add 1 to token_length so np.log2() doesn't receive 0 when token_length is 0
    padded_length = 2**int(np.ceil(np.log2(token_length + 1)))

    # Fill cur_output_tokens with 0's until it reaches padded_length
    padded = cur_output_tokens + [0] * (padded_length - token_length)
    padded_with_batch = np.array(padded)[None, :] # Don't replace this None! This is a way of setting the batch dim

    # model expects a tuple containing two padded tensors (with batch)
    output, _ = model((padded_with_batch, padded_with_batch)) 
    # HINT: output has shape (1, padded_length, vocab_size)
    # To get log_probs you need to index output wih 0 in the first dim
    # token_length in the second dim and all of the entries for the last dim.
    log_probs = output[0, token_length, :]
    
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    return int(np.argmax(log_probs))
```


```python
# Test it out!
sentence_test_nxt_symbl = "I want to fly in the sky."
detokenize([next_symbol(tokenize(sentence_test_nxt_symbl)+[0], model)])
```




    'The'



**Expected Output:**
```CPP
'The'
```


```python

```

### 5.1 Greedy decoding

Now you will implement the greedy_decode algorithm that will call the `next_symbol` function. It takes in the input_sentence, the trained model and returns the the decoded sentence. 

<a name='ex07'></a>
### Exercise 07

**Instructions**: Implement the greedy_decode algorithm. 


```python
# UNQ_C10
# Decoding functions.
def greedy_decode(input_sentence, model, next_symbol=next_symbol, tokenize=tokenize, detokenize=detokenize):
    """Greedy decode function.

    Args:
        input_sentence (string): a sentence or article.
        model (trax.layers.combinators.Serial): Transformer model.

    Returns:
        string: summary of the input.
    """
    
    ### START CODE HERE (REPLACE INSTANCES OF 'None' WITH YOUR CODE) ###
    # Use tokenize()
    cur_output_tokens = tokenize(input_sentence) + [0]    
    generated_output = [] 
    cur_output = 0 
    EOS = 1 
    
    while cur_output != EOS:
        # Get next symbol
        cur_output = next_symbol(cur_output_tokens, model)
        # Append next symbol to original sentence
        cur_output_tokens.append(cur_output)
        # Append next symbol to generated sentence
        generated_output.append(cur_output)
        
        print(detokenize(generated_output))
    
    ### END CODE HERE ###
        
    return detokenize(generated_output)
```


```python

test_sentence = "It was a sunny day when I went to the market to buy some flowers. But I only found roses, not tulips."
